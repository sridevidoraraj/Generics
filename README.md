## Generics

### Structure

This project structured using intellij platform and maven as build system.

### About Project

#### Generic Class

-> A Generic class simply means that the items or functions in that class can be generalized with the parameter(example T) to specify that we can add any type as a parameter in place of T like Integer, Character, String, Double or any other user-defined type.

-> In this project, we used string and boolean type parameter is passed.

-> The output of the program will be :

Type: java.lang.String

Type: java.lang.Boolean

#### Generic Method

-> Generic Java method takes a parameter and returns some value after performing a task. It is exactly like a normal function, however, a generic method has type parameters that are cited by actual type. This allows the generic method to be used in a more general way. The compiler takes care of the type of safety which enables programmers to code easily since they do not have to perform long, individual type castings.

-> In this program, we used two methods isEqual, and compare.

-> The methods are called in another class file and the output will be 

true

true

0

#### Generic Interface

-> The benefits of Generic Interface are as follows:

This is implemented for different data types.

It allows putting constraints i.e. bounds on data types for which interface is implemented

-> In this project, interface is defined in different file.

-> In main class, interface is class with different data types.

-> The output will be :

Max value in intOfArray: 8

Min value in intOfArray: 2

Max value in charOfArray: w

Min value in charOfArray: A

Max value in strOfArray: xyz

Min value in strOfArray: abc

#### TwoParametersGenerics

-> Generic class is declared with two parameters.

-> They are called in main class with creating object to it.

-> The output will be :

U Type: java.lang.String

V Type: java.lang.Integer
